## Current Project Status

This project was mainly made as I was bored and wanted something simple to make, this led to building a simple forms app (hence the name). This app is practically a clone of microsoft forms, I wanted to implement authentication and saving of the forms through a relational databse which led to using postgresql.

## Projects Future Goals

- Share editing of the same form by multiple users

- Real time editing of the form so the edits are broadcast to other editing users

- AI form creation

- AI form question checker to ensure the questions result in non-biased results
